# Fun Afternoon Project

## Doing assignments that aren't mine

I'm a teaching assistant for a younger year course, and their final assignment
looks kind of fun. I'm gonna go through it in leisure time because it touches
on some really fun things to think about:

Robust menu design  
Optimization  
Data structures  
Parsing  
Encapsulation

The key concept is that you're simulating the passage of shopping carts through
a checkout system. Each cart has a list of items, and there are a number of
checkouts to place the carts into. It is your task to parse the cart and item
files, do some figuring with the data in them, and then provide the optimal
setup given a number of checkouts.

I should probably be layoung out stack frames on my c minus compiler, but 
making a robust menu and project setup for this held some strange allure. Now
that I've gotten things laid out and compiling, I think I'll use the list type
I started here for my frames.
